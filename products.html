            My top 3 favorite projects are:<br><br>
            Lotto Program Generator: Our family and I always wanted to win the jackpot. I came up with that idea since my first year in college and wanted the program to generate winning numbers. I got feedback from my mother who is an expert in math. I hope to win the jackpot so that I can buy my house in The States when I graduate.BY ETHAN <br><br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Winning numbers database: This program displays all the winning numbers that were drawn from the past dates. I have developed a solution that will count the numbers by frequency so that we'll know to play that number next time. BY ETHAN<br><br>
